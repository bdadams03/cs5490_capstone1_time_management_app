Members: Benjamin Adams, Zachary Bent

# Introduction:
Many people who are affected by ADHD struggle staying on task for long periods of time,
planning a habitual workday, and remembering to take medicine. This proposal aims to
create a software that lets the user plan the day to make sure you are still on task,
among other things and through doing so, alleviates the problem.

# Objectives:
• Design a weekly calander planner that can assign specific tasks to specific days of specific months
• Add a sort system that allows the user to sort by task type
• Let user export calander as text document

# Scope:
The scope of the project will  b simple, an application that can be simulated in any application development software and used by a
desktop.

# Proposed Solution:
An application that allows one to plan their week to create habit.

# Technology Stack:
• Languages: Python  
• Database: SQL or None  
• Deployment Platform: Local  

# Expected Outcome:
A zip file containting the described software
