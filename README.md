# Focus Calender: An ADHD Assistive Alarm/Calendar
Members: Benjamin Adams, Zachary Bent

# Introduction:
Many people who are affected by ADHD struggle staying on task for long periods of time,
planning a habitual workday, and remembering to take medicine. This proposal aims to
create a software that rings an alarm throughout the day to ask if you are still on task,
among other things and through doing so, alleviates the problem.

# Objectives:
• Design a weekly calander planner that procedurely rings alarms on specific days of
the week  
• Add a reminder system that limits the amount of time a user can hit snooze  
• Assure there is some sort of reward for not using up all snoozes, like fun display
options  

# Scope:
The scope of the project will like be simple, preferably an application one can run on their
phone, if not, it can be simulated in any application development software and used as a
desktop app instead.

# Proposed Solution:
An application that allows one to plan their week to create habit. Every time a
work/study/important event occurs, a procedural alarm will go off during it to make sure
that the user is still doing that task, with consistency and snooze attempts being
customizable. If the user is able to stay focused the whole time, they can be rewarded with
digital cosmetics.

# Technology Stack:
• Languages: Python  
• Database: SQL or None  
• Deployment Platform: Unsure/Local  

# Expected Outcome:
A working smarphone app or at least a build for one that can be exported in a zip file and/or
executable via godot.
